Build the world model for this forecast.
1. Decide what kind of answer the question asks for:
   - "binary": whether something happens. It resolves YES or NO.
   - "choice": which of a few named outcomes happens (who wins, which option, which way it goes). List 2 to 6 mutually exclusive outcomes that cover the realistic space; add "Other" only when the named ones leave real probability uncovered.
   - "number": how much or how many (a price, a level, a count, a rate, a share). Give the unit.
2. Pin the question down: for binary, one proposition that will clearly resolve YES or NO; for choice and number, the exact question. Give a horizon date and how a reader will judge the result.
3. Start from the outside view: for binary, a base rate from reference classes; for choice, a prior share for each outcome; for number, the current or reference value as an anchor. Say what it rests on.
4. Name 6 to 12 actors that will shape the outcome: states, leaders, organisations, companies, markets, armed or civic groups, places. Put each on Earth (capital, headquarters, or where they act) with decimal lat/lng and an ISO 3166 country code.
5. Map 8 to 20 relations between those actors.
6. Cite the sources that bear on the outcome, by id.${hasSeed ? `
7. Quote up to 8 passages from SEED that bear on the outcome, each copied word for word (at most 240 characters). They are numbered d1, d2… in your order; the panel will quote them, and your evidence can cite them.` : ''}
